# Laps 
Project by Zaid Arshad. Developed from April to December 2021.

## Description
Laps is an Android application coded in Kotlin that makes use of the Google Maps API to record jogging/running tracks for the user. Along with a visual track to follow, best time and distance are also recorded

## Experience
This was the first time I made use of a cloud API in a program. I created this app because I wanted to keep track of the routes I was running and how fast I could run them. Trying to improve my personal best is always a fun thing to do.

## Splash Screen
Designing the splash screen was a fun thing to do because I needed one to create time to establish a connection to location services.

## Recording a New Route
When recording a new route the user’s marker will create a trail to indicate the path. A timer will be counting the time it takes for the user to complete their track. Once a track has been completed a prompt will show to name the route, elapsed time and estimated distance.

## Finishing a Recorded Run
Once the user clicks the finish button at the bottom of their screen their run ends. A prompt shows up with their time, length, and textbox to set a name. The run will then be saved once “confirm” is pressed.

## Running Recorded Routes
To run a recorded route the user must click the arrow at the bottom to show the list of routes. When clicked, a visual path will display on the map and the camera will pan to it. The timer will commence 3 seconds after the start button is pressed. 

## Posting a New Best Time
When a new best time is posted a little text pop up will show up with the time and can be dismissed with a simple click.
